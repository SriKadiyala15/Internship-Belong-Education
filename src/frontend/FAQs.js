  "Vision Care Principles": [
    {
      question: "Is there evidence that supports the Dot Glasses approach to vision care?",
      answer: "Yes, the approach is backed by field studies and proven effective in underserved communities. It restores vision affordably and efficiently where access is limited.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can a “good enough” prescription damage someone’s vision?",
      answer: "No, a basic prescription improves vision safely for daily tasks. It won't damage eyesight but isn't a substitute for complex eye care.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are Dot Glasses suitable for young children?",
      answer: "Dot Glasses are generally suited for individuals aged 10 and above. For younger children, professional eye care is recommended.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you deal with astigmatism?",
      answer: "Dot Glasses currently do not correct astigmatism. Those with astigmatism are advised to consult an eye care professional.",
    },
    {
      question: "What do you do if someone has a cataract?",
      answer: "Cataracts require medical treatment and surgery, not just glasses. Individuals with cataracts are referred to a healthcare provider.",
    },
  ],
  "Product Details and Training": [
    {
      question: "How long does it take to train someone to start selling/distributing DOT Glasses?",
      answer: "Training typically takes just a few hours. It's simple and designed for quick, hands-on learning.",
    },
    {
      question: "If we have optometrists to measure vision accurately, can Dot Glasses provide a wider range of lenses to meet the prescription needs?",
      answer: "Dot Glasses use pre-manufactured lenses for cost-efficiency. They do not offer a wide prescription range like traditional optometry.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does a Dot Glasses representative need to be present for training?",
      answer: "No, training can be done remotely using online materials and manuals. On-site presence is optional.",
    },
    {
      question: "What do you do if someone has a cataract?",
      answer: "They are referred to a clinic or hospital for surgical evaluation. Dot Glasses cannot correct vision impaired by cataracts.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are Dot Glasses certified?",
      answer: "Yes, they comply with international optical and safety standards. Certification ensures quality and reliability.",
    },
  ],
};

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "If we have optometrists to measure vision accurately, can Dot Glasses provide a wider range of lenses to meet the prescription needs?",
    answer: "Yes, Dot Glasses can accommodate accurate prescriptions measured by certified optometrists. While the core offering uses standardized lenses for quick distribution, the organization can provide a wider range of lenses when professional prescriptions are available.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are Dot Glasses certified?",
    answer: "Yes, Dot Glasses are ISO-certified and comply with international safety and optical standards. They are approved for global distribution and meet the requirements for basic vision correction solutions in low-resource settings.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to train someone to start selling/distributing DOT Glasses?",
    answer: "Training typically takes between 1 to 2 days. The process is designed to be simple and intuitive, enabling local entrepreneurs or health workers with minimal experience to begin vision testing and distributing glasses effectively.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does a Dot Glasses representative need to be present for training?",
    answer: "No, a physical presence is not necessary. Dot Glasses provides a comprehensive training toolkit, including printed materials and video tutorials. Remote support is also available to guide local teams through the process.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of ongoing support is provided after training to sell or distribute Dot Glasses?",
    answer: "Dot Glasses offers continuous remote support and updated training materials to assist distributors. This ensures sellers stay informed and can effectively serve their communities.",
  },
